<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>To activate the Playback Hotkeys you have to press the Play Button (unless the <em>Always Active</em> option is on, which will activate all hotkeys when the program window is not active). <strong>Playback will not start immediately after pressing the Play Button, it will start when you press one of the Active Hotkeys</strong>. This behavior is intended to allow the user to select the desired starting window/control/mouse position before start playing.<br/>
You can also activate Playback Hotkeys by double-clicking the TrayIcon or right-clicking on it and selecting <em>Play</em>.<br/>
Unchecked rows will be ignored during playback.
The <em>Play Current Macro</em> button will run the active Macro immediately without activating Hotkeys.</p>
<h2 id="hotkeys">Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Hotkeys are sometimes referred to as shortcut keys and are used to run/play the macros. Playback Hotkeys are set in the hotkey toolbars in the main window.</p>
<p>Use <code>Backspace</code> to clear the hotkeys. Press it twice to set <code>Backspace</code> as the hotkey.</p>
<h3 id="play">Play</h3>
<p>Selects the Automatic Hotkey to execute the currently selected Macro.<br/>
You can make combinations with modifiers such as <code>Ctrl + X</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Key</strong>: To make combination with the Windows key, check the option <em>Add the Windows key to &quot;Play&quot; hotkey</em> in the Options menu or in the Options toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Joystick Buttons</strong>: To use a Joystick button as the Play Hotkey, check the option <em>Use a joystick button as hotkey</em> in the Options menu or in the Options toolbar.</p>
<h3 id="manual">Manual</h3>
<p>Selects the Manual Hotkey to execute the currently selected Macro step-by-step. This is usually used to debug the Macro. If Show Info option is on a tooltip show the last and next steps will be shown next to the mouse pointer. This hotkey cannot be a combination with modifiers.</p>
<h3 id="stop">Stop</h3>
<p>Selects the Hotkey to stop execution and return it to start. You can also stop Playback by double-clicking the TrayIcon or right-clicking on it and selecting <em>Stop</em>. You can make combinations with modifiers such as <code>Ctrl + X</code>.</p>
<h3 id="pause">Pause</h3>
<p>Selects the Hotkey to pause execution. Press the hotkey again to resume playback. You can also pause/unpause Playback by Middle-Clicking the TrayIcon. You can make combinations with modifiers such as <code>Ctrl + X</code>.</p>
<h2 id="controls-toolbar">Controls Toolbar</h2>
<p>This small window allows you to control Playback and Recording using an interface in addition to the Hotkeys. It will be displayed when the <em>Playback</em> or <em>Record</em> button is pressed and the <em>Show Controls</em> option is checked or you can open it manually from the Macro Menu, Tray Menu and pressing Ctrl+B on the main window.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-macros">Multiple Macros</h3>
<p>Macro Creator supports multiple Macros / Hotkeys. Each Macro will have its own Auto and Manual Hotkey that are shown when you add/select a Macro tab.</p>
<p>When you press the Play Button (or when the main window is not active if &quot;Always Active&quot; option is on) all valid Hotkeys will be activated for all non-empty Macros. A traytip will be displayed (if <em>Show Info</em> is on) showing how many Play Hotkeys were activated. If any duplicate is found NO Hotkey will be activated.</p>
<h3 id="debugging-macros">Debugging Macros</h3>
<p>In addition to the Manual Hotkey you can select one of these options from the Macro menu:</p>
<h3 id="play-from-selected-row">Play From Selected Row</h3>
<p>If checked Playback will run each Macro from the first selected row in its list. Valid for all Playback commands.</p>
<h3 id="play-until-selected-row">Play Until Selected Row</h3>
<p>If checked Playback will stop each Macro when the first selected row in its list is reached. Valid for all Playback commands.</p>
<h3 id="play-selected-rows">Play Selected Rows</h3>
<p>If checked Playback will only execute selected rows in each Macro. Valid for all Playback commands.</p>
<p>You can also view the list of variables and contents from the File menu and Tray Icon menu.</p>
<h2 id="context-sensitive-hotkeys">Context Sensitive Hotkeys</h2>
<p>Makes all Hotkeys context-sensitive. Such hotkeys will only work depending on the type of window that is active or exists, or if an <a href="Variables.html#expressions">expression</a> is evaluated to true.</p>
<p>Select the type of condition and enter the identification of the window, or use the &quot;Get Window&quot; button to retrieve it.</p>
<p>For the <em>#If Expression</em> option you can provide any valid <a href="Variables.html#expressions">expression</a>.</p>
<pre class="NoIndent">#If MyVar <em>; Hotkeys will only work when MyVar evaluates to True</em>
#If GetKeyState(&quot;ScrollLock&quot;, &quot;T&quot;) <em>; Hotkeys will only work when the ScrollLock key is on</em>
#If Var1 = &quot;A&quot; || Var1 = &quot;B&quot;</pre>
<p>For an expression to be <code>true</code> it must be a number other than 0 or a non-empty string.</p>
<p>You can also use <a href="Functions.html#user-defined-functions">User-defined functions</a> with the <em>#If Expression</em> option.</p>
<p>This option affects ALL Hotkeys and will be saved to the programs settings when it's closed. There's a text tip at the bottom-right of the main window to show if it's active. To deactivate this option select <em>None</em> in the list.</p>
<p>For more information see AutoHotkey documentation: <a href="http://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/_IfWinActive.htm" target="_blank">#IfWinActive</a> and <a href="http://autohotkey.com/docs/commands/_If.htm" target="_blank">#If</a>.</p>
<h2 id="playback-options">Playback Options</h2>
<p>To change options click the Options button on the main window or select Options Menu &gt; Settings. Some of the options can also be accessible from the <em>Playback Options</em> button on the <a href="#controls-toolbar">Controls Toolbar</a>.</p>
<h3 id="title-match-mode">Title Match Mode</h3>
<p>Sets the matching behavior of the WinTitle parameter in commands such as WinWait.</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>: A window's title must start with the specified WinTitle to be a match.<br/>
<strong>2</strong>: A window's title can contain WinTitle anywhere inside it to be a match.<br/>
<strong>3</strong>: A window's title must exactly match WinTitle to be a match.<br/>
<strong>RegEx</strong>: Changes WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle, and ExcludeText to be regular expressions. Do not enclose such expressions in quotes when using them with commands. For example: WinActivate Untitled.*Notepad. RegEx also applies to ahk_class.</p>
<p><strong>Fast</strong>: This is the default behavior. Performance may be substantially better than Slow, but certain WinText elements for some types of windows may not be &quot;seen&quot; by the various window commands.<br/>
<strong>Slow</strong>: Can be much slower, but all possible WinText is retrieved from every window as a windowing command searches through them for a match. Window Spy reveals which parts of a Window's text (if any) require the slow mode.</p>
