changes:
- bugfix in UI: the grid selection had trouble when many items were in the list
  (the original trick to scroll the grid selection into view when adding an item had
   unintended side effects, the new solution from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18019425/scrollintoview-for-wpf-datagrid-mvvm 
   hopefully works better)
- changed version scheme for assemblies: command line and UI programm get individual versions now,
  rolled version of ConsoleMasterPassword back to 1.01.00 because that was the last actual update there.
